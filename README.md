The Company INC asked a few independent programmers for to create an simple bank account application which should deliver following functionality: 

Check Account balance 

Deposit income 

Transfer funds to other account 

Close account 

There is also a requirement about how app should look like. It should be a console application with initial menu which has items listed below: 

Create account 

Login in to account 

Exit 

And the second one, after user of that app log into, like: 

Balance 

 Add income 

 Do transfer 

 Close account 

 Log out 

 Exit 

The main security way to authorize users of that app is a credentials (card number + PIN), which should be also generated by app with “Create account” function. This process should implement a Luhn algorithm with assumption that the every card number starts with a sequence of numbers like 400000. The rest of 16 numberd in this sequence should be random generated.
